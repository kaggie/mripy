# Voronoi Cell Merging and Path Optimization (Conceptual)

This document outlines a conceptual framework for merging Voronoi cells based on attributes and then performing path optimization.

## Merge Voronoi Cells and Optimize Paths (Conceptual Outline)

-   **Function:** `temp_cell_merging_paths.merge_voronoi_cells_and_optimize_paths(voronoi_cells_vertices_list: list, point_attributes: torch.Tensor, merge_threshold: float, cost_function: callable | None = None, path_objective: str | None = None) -> tuple[list, list]`
    (Note: Currently implemented as a conceptual outline in a temporary file `temp_cell_merging_paths.py`.)

-   **Description:** This function provides a high-level conceptual outline for merging adjacent Voronoi cells based on the similarity of attributes associated with their original seed points, and then performing simplified path optimization related to these merged regions. Many of the underlying geometric and algorithmic complexities are simplified or treated as placeholders in this initial version.

-   **Input Parameters:**
    -   `voronoi_cells_vertices_list (list)`: A list of Voronoi cells. Each cell is represented as a list of PyTorch Tensors, where each tensor (e.g., shape `(2,)` for 2D or `(3,)` for 3D) defines a vertex of that cell. This structure is similar to the output of `construct_voronoi_polygons_2d`.
    -   `point_attributes (torch.Tensor)`: A tensor of shape `(S, A)`, where `S` is the number of original Voronoi cells (and corresponds to the number of input seed points that generated them), and `A` is the number of attributes for each cell/point. These attributes are used to decide if adjacent cells should be merged.
    -   `merge_threshold (float)`: A scalar float value. If a calculated "dissimilarity" score (e.g., Euclidean distance between attribute vectors) of two adjacent cells is less than this threshold, they are considered candidates for merging.
    -   `cost_function (callable | None, optional)`: A placeholder for a Python callable that would take two points and potentially cell geometry information, returning a cost for moving between them. This is not used in the current conceptual implementation but is part of the signature for future expansion.
    -   `path_objective (str | None, optional)`: A string indicating the desired path optimization task. Examples:
        -   `"connect_centroids_within_merged_regions"`: Aims to identify paths connecting the centroids of the original cells that now form part of the same merged region.
        -   `"connect_merged_region_main_centroids"`: Aims to identify a path connecting the overall centroids of the final merged regions.
        This is used for placeholder path logic in the current version.

-   **Conceptual Algorithm Steps:**
    1.  **Input Validation**: Basic checks on input types and shape compatibility.
    2.  **Adjacency Graph Construction (Simplified)**:
        *   The process of determining which Voronoi cells are geometrically adjacent (share an edge in 2D or a face in 3D) is complex.
        *   The current conceptual version includes a highly simplified adjacency detection for 2D cells by checking for a minimum number of shared vertices between cell polygons. This is a placeholder for a more robust geometric adjacency algorithm.
    3.  **Cell Merging Logic**:
        *   A Union-Find data structure is used to manage the merging of cells into regions. Initially, each cell is its own distinct region.
        *   The function iterates through pairs of (conceptually) adjacent cells.
        *   For each pair, it calculates a dissimilarity score based on their `point_attributes` (e.g., Euclidean distance between attribute vectors).
        *   If this dissimilarity is below `merge_threshold`, the two cells (or the regions they belong to) are merged using the Union-Find `unite_sets` operation.
        *   After processing all relevant pairs, the Union-Find structure is used to consolidate the final list of merged regions, where each merged region is represented as a list of indices of the original cells it contains.
    4.  **Path Optimization (Placeholder / Highly Simplified)**:
        *   This part is highly conceptual in the current implementation.
        *   If `path_objective` is `"connect_centroids_within_merged_regions"`, it collects the centroids of the original cells within each final merged region and returns these lists of centroids as "paths".
        *   If `path_objective` is `"connect_merged_region_main_centroids"`, it calculates a pseudo-centroid for each entire merged region (by averaging all vertices of all original cells within it) and returns a list of these main centroids as a "path".
        *   **Note**: No actual graph-based pathfinding (like A* or Dijkstra) or use of the `cost_function` is implemented. The "paths" returned are conceptual lists of waypoints.

-   **Return Value:**
    -   `final_merged_regions (list)`: A list of lists. Each inner list contains the integer indices of the original Voronoi cells that constitute a single merged region. For example, `[[0, 1], [2]]` would mean cell 0 and cell 1 merged into one region, and cell 2 is its own region.
    -   `optimized_paths (list)`: A list of "paths". In the current conceptual version, each path is a list of PyTorch Tensors representing waypoints (e.g., centroids), as determined by the simplified `path_objective` logic.

-   **Dependencies:** PyTorch.

-   **Important Considerations for Full Implementation:**
    -   **Robust Adjacency**: A full implementation would require a geometrically sound method to determine shared Voronoi edges/faces.
    -   **Merged Geometry**: Calculating the precise geometric boundary (union of polygons/polyhedra) of merged cells is a complex task, not handled in this outline.
    -   **Pathfinding**: True path optimization would involve graph search algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, etc.) operating on either the Voronoi graph or a grid representation, using the `cost_function`.
    -   **Attribute Dissimilarity**: The specific metric for comparing `point_attributes` can be customized.
