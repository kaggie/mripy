# Voronoi Density Weights (PyTorch Backend - Conceptual)

This document describes a conceptually refactored version of the `compute_voronoi_density_weights` function, adapted to use a PyTorch-native Voronoi backend.

## Compute Voronoi Density Weights (PyTorch Version - Conceptual)

-   **Function:** `temp_density_weights_pytorch.compute_voronoi_density_weights_pytorch(points: torch.Tensor, bounds: torch.Tensor | None = None, space_dim: int | None = None) -> torch.Tensor`
    (Note: Currently implemented as a conceptual refactor in a temporary file `temp_density_weights_pytorch.py`. This file also contains copied versions of necessary helper functions like `ConvexHull`, clipping utilities, and placeholder Voronoi construction functions for self-containment during this development phase.)

-   **Description:** This function computes Voronoi-based density compensation weights for a set of input points (e.g., k-space sample points). It is a refactored version of an original function that relied on `scipy.spatial.Voronoi`. This version is adapted to conceptually use a PyTorch-based Voronoi diagram construction pipeline. The density weights are typically inversely proportional to the area (2D) or volume (3D) of the Voronoi cell corresponding to each input point.

-   **Input Parameters:**
    -   `points (torch.Tensor)`: A PyTorch tensor of shape `(N, Dim)`, where `N` is the number of input points and `Dim` is their dimensionality (2 or 3).
    -   `bounds (torch.Tensor | None, optional)`: A PyTorch tensor of shape `(2, Dim)` defining an axis-aligned bounding box `[[min_coords], [max_coords]]`. If provided, Voronoi cells are clipped to these bounds before their area/volume is calculated. Defaults to `None` (no explicit bounding).
    -   `space_dim (int | None, optional)`: The dimensionality of the space (2 or 3). If `None`, it's inferred from `points.shape[1]`.

-   **Key Structural Changes from SciPy-based Version:**
    1.  **Voronoi Backend Removed**: The direct dependency on `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` is removed.
    2.  **PyTorch Voronoi Construction (Conceptual)**:
        -   The function now conceptually calls PyTorch-based Voronoi construction functions (e.g., `construct_voronoi_polygons_2d` or `construct_voronoi_polyhedra_3d`, which are currently placeholders within `temp_density_weights_pytorch.py` but would eventually come from modules like `temp_voronoi_from_delaunay.py`).
        -   These functions are expected to return a list of Voronoi cells, where each cell is defined by its vertices (as PyTorch tensors).
    3.  **Region and Vertex Processing**: Iteration logic is adapted to work with this new list-of-cell-vertices format, instead of SciPy's `vor.point_region`, `vor.regions`, and `vor.vertices` attributes.
    4.  **Open/Closed Cell Handling (Conceptual Challenge)**: The SciPy Voronoi object uses a -1 vertex index to denote unbounded regions. The current PyTorch Voronoi construction placeholders do not explicitly define "points at infinity." This refactor assumes that cells are defined by their finite vertices, and clipping against `bounds` (if provided) is the primary mechanism for handling the extent of cells, including those that would be unbounded. Robustly translating the concept of open regions and their interaction with bounds from SciPy's output to a custom Delaunay-dual Voronoi output is a significant challenge and is simplified in this conceptual version.
    5.  **Clipping and Geometric Measures**:
        -   Cell clipping (if `bounds` are provided) uses PyTorch-based functions (`clip_polygon_2d`, `clip_polyhedron_3d` - copied from `geometry_core.py` content).
        -   Area (2D) or Volume (3D) of the (potentially clipped) cells is calculated using the PyTorch `ConvexHull` class (copied from `geometry_core.py` content).
    6.  **Normalization**: The final weights are normalized using a PyTorch-based `normalize_weights` function.

-   **Return Value:**
    -   A PyTorch tensor of shape `(N,)` containing the calculated density compensation weights for each input point. These weights are typically non-negative and normalized to sum to 1.0.
    -   Returns uniform weights (1/N) if `N <= space_dim`.
    -   Returns an empty tensor if `N = 0`.

-   **Dependencies (within the temporary file context):**
    -   PyTorch.
    -   Placeholder Voronoi construction functions (`construct_voronoi_polygons_2d`, `construct_voronoi_polyhedra_3d`).
    -   Copied geometry helper functions (`ConvexHull`, `clip_polygon_2d`, `clip_polyhedron_3d`, `normalize_weights`, `EPSILON`).

-   **Important Notes on Conceptual Nature:**
    -   This refactoring is primarily **structural** to demonstrate how the function would interface with a PyTorch-based Voronoi backend.
    -   The accuracy and robustness of the results heavily depend on the (currently placeholder) PyTorch Voronoi construction functions. Differences in how Voronoi diagrams are computed (e.g., qhull in SciPy vs. a custom Delaunay-dual method) can lead to variations in cell shapes, especially near boundaries or for points on the convex hull of the input set.
    -   The handling of unbounded Voronoi cells, particularly their interaction with finite `bounds`, is a complex topic that is simplified in this conceptual version. A full, robust implementation would require careful geometric logic for these cases.
